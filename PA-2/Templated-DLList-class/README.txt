Short description or pseudocode:
This program creates a templated doubly linked list with dummy header and trailer nodes.


Testing process:
    1. First I went through and templated all of the functions from part 1.
    2. Then when I compiled it there were errors which were fixed by changing the default parameters to T().
    3. After the original functions were working I added the other tests from part 1 to ensure that the other functions were also working with strings.
    4. I added an extra test case to make sure the original lists were empty after calling the move constructor/assignment operator as well.
    5. Then I checked some of the scenarios to make sure the exceptions were being thrown and caught when they should be.
