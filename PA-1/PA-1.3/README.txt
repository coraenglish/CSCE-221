N/A


Short description or pseudocode:
This program creates a templated Collection class that serves as a dynamic array to hold stress balls and jeans. It can copy, remove, and sort the elements.


Testing process:
    1. Being honest here, didn't try to complie this until I finished all of the templating and it worked fine. :)
    2. After I compiled it I ran it with the jeans and stressball cases.


Write about the generic programming using templates based on this assignment Part 3:
Generic programming allows for algorithms to be written in terms of types which are specified later that are then called with specific types as parameters.
Another example of this besides the collection class we wrote in part 3 would be a templated doubly linked list class. This would allow for linked lists of
any types to be instantiated when the time came, not just a specific list for integer or floating point values. Templates provide programmers with a lot of
reusability value when designing different classes or functions.
